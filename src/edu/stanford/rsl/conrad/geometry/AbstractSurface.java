/**
 * Abstract class to model n dimensional surfaces.
 * Note that the internal dimension (cf. description by Piegl), i.e. its parametrization is always two dimensional.
 * Hence, a surface can only be evaluated using a two dimensions. 
 * That is the reason, why the abstract surface overides the evaluate PointND method.
 * In it only the first two dimensions of the ND point are used for evaluation of the surface.
 * The abstract method evaluate(double, double) must be implemented by any derived class that is not abstract to describe how to do the actual evaluation.
